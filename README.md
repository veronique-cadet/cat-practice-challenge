Hey!

First you do:
npm install
npm start
and run on another port son-server --watch db.json -p 3001

Cool!

So for this we should:

1. Render all of the cats on the page
2. Post a new cat
3. Delete a cat using the angry cat emoji button
4. Search a cat name!
5. Look for cats by breed in the dropdown

You can just do a search and dropdown seperately to know you can do both. Remember to be able to filter both you would need to filter the filter, but you can just practice one or the other or do both if you feel like it!
